#Matthew Blum 2/3/2020; create a script with two variables, decide which is larger, or display the relation.  Only use if once.

#assign variables
a = 5
b = 7

#if statement: if a is larger than b, print
if a > b:
	print("a is greater than b")
#elif statement: if not, also print
elif a < b:
	print("a is smaller than b")

#else statement: if not, also print
else:
	print("a is equal to b")
